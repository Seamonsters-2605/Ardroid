# ArdroidScript
When ArdroidScript is finished, it will allow the Android controller app to run scripted actions, with a built in script editor on the app. The scripting language is designed to be discoverable and as simple as possible to use, with no programming experience required. It is inspired by Kodu Game Lab.

The script editor is a work in progress and is currently hidden from the interface. To access it in the app:
- Tap `Dev Tools` on the main screen
- Choose `Yes` for the warning message
- Tap `Open Screen`
- Type `ScriptScreen` with correct capitalization and no spaces in the box
- Tap `Confirm`

Currently the editor is finished but the app cannot compile or run code.

This directory has the "compiler" for the language. It is written in Java and will eventually be added to the app as an App Inventor extension.
