# ARDROID
A generic robot controller for the Arduino101 board with an Adafruit v2 motor shield. There are two parts to this: an Android app, written with MIT App Inventor 2, serving as a remote control for the robot; and an Arduino sketch that receives signals from the controller over Bluetooth and moves motors accordingly. The app allows customization of the controls for moving motors and for driving. A rudimentary scripting system is also in progress; see the `ArdroidScript` directory.

## To do:
This is a work in progress.
- Control stepper motors
- Steer drive
- Run scripts
